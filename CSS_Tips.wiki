* CSS properties, such as margin, are not inherited. I made a heading inside a div and expected the setting of the div's margins to affect the heading. Margins and borders are not inherited. Colour is inherited.
* A CSS Reset is a CSS file used to "even out" browser inconsistencies and reset the default user agent stylings such as margins and font size. The advice is to take a reset file and modify it for your own needs. If an reset element is not used in your markup it's worth removing it from the reset. If the reset value isn't what you want, it's better to modify the reset file itself instead of overriding values in your own stylesheets.
